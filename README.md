# Space–Entropy–Pointer (SEP) Tool Set  
## **Master Index & Navigation Guide**  
### **Technical Note #0 (Online Version)**  
Author: **Xiaofei Feng**  
Version: **0.1**

This repository serves as the **central navigation hub** for all documents, notes, and analytical materials related to the **Space–Entropy–Pointer (SEP) Tool Set**.

This index provides:

- Links to the foundational axioms  
- A categorized directory of future technical notes  
- A long-term list of major open problems in modern physics  
- Keyword tags for searchability  
- Version history and update tracking  

All future Technical Notes will link back to this Master Index.

# 3. Appendix A — Extended Catalogue of Open Problems in Physics  
### *(For Reference and Future Analytical Notes)*  
This catalogue contains unresolved questions in cosmology, gravitation, quantum foundations, QFT, particle physics, and condensed matter.  
It is **purely descriptive**, without implying that the SEP tool set explains or solves these issues.

A selection of categories is shown below.  
(Full 160-item list is included in the Technical Note and maintained here.)
